    <h1>Hi! I'm Susie Li </h1>
        <h2>A recent trip</h2>
        Over the summer, I traveled to France with my family. We started in 
        the South of France, visiting Bordeaux, Aix-en-Provence, and the 
        countryside of Provence. After that, we made our way to Paris, where 
        we saw some landmarks, and finished the trip with a visit to Nice on 
        the coast. Each place had its own unique blend of history, art, and 
        local traditions, making the trip enjoyable and memorable.

        <h2>Pet names</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A pomeranian named Mochi</li>
            <li>A hamster named Boba</li>
            <li>A cat named Zeus</li>
        </ul>
                
        <h2>Favorite restaurant</h2>
        One of my favourite restaurants is 
        <a href="https://davellenewyork.com">Davelle</a>, a kissaten style cafe 
        (Japanese traditional cafe) in East Village, New York. I really like Davelle 
        for its cozy, intimate atmosphere and its simple yet delicious Japanese menu.
        I especially appreciate how the dishes, like their signature curry and toast, 
        strike a perfect balance between comfort food and high-quality ingredients. 
        Itâ€™s the perfect spot for meeting up with friends and spending an afternoon.

            <p> One of my favourite foods is sushi, I love serving it on an arranged
                platter, with a variety of rolls and sashimi that showcase different 
                textures and flavors. Eating it is all about savoring the delicate 
                balance of fresh fish, seasoned rice, and the tangy kick of wasabi 
                and soy sauce. Whether it's a casual meal or a special occasion, 
                sushi can always be a fun choice. </p> <br>

                <td>Eunsong Kim's "The Politics of Collecting" explores how 
                    collecting practices intersect with issues of power, 
                    identity, and representation, emphasizing how these 
                    practices can both challenge and reinforce existing 
                    social hierarchies. Kim examines how collections 
                    function as sites of political and cultural negotiation, 
                    shaping and reflecting broader societal dynamics.</td>
